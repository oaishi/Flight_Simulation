# Flight_Simulation

A d3.js based Flight Simulation using real-world data from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). The simulation data can be saved for labelling and tracking purpose. The jupyter notebook maps the TopoJson longitude-latitude data to 2D pixel space for enabling tracking in the captured video.
